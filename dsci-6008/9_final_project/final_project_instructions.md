6008 Final Project
----

Due dates: 
    - In-class presentation - 7-20-17 at 9a
    - Code - 7-20-17 at 5p
    
Purpose: Model data with techniques covered in class.

After doing this assignment you should be able to:

-   Organize data to enable analysis
-   Perform EDA to understand the data
-   Fit an "advanced" statistics model
-   Write working and well-organized code
-   Present your results to a technical audience 

First, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning, and preprocessing. Second, model your data. Note - These steps are iterative (a little preprocessing, a little modeling, redo the preprocessing, ...).

Ideally this project would be become a part of your public Data Science portfolio.  [Here are instructions on how to do that](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-share-data-science-portfolio/).

----

For each of steps, I want a logical justification for the steps you took. Explain why you think that is. Evidence and citations always help!

The deliverables are an in-class presentation and code. The presentation style, or lack of style, will not be scored. Code style __will be__ scored.

Hints
----

- Go end-to-end as quickly possible. From raw data -> simple model -> evaluation.
    + Then explore alternatives for each stage.
- Make the code run, make it right, make it fast (in that order).
- How do get a "A"? Do something out-of-the-box (seriously).

----
Challenge Level
------

- Create a Python package. Abstract your code to apply to other domains.
