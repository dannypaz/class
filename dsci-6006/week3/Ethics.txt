Hello All,

Alessandro will teach a class on ethics on Monday, January 30th. To make sure we hit the ground running, please make sure to carefully read Alessandro's instructions for Monday.


Please read each of the following three articles and come prepared with answers to each of the questions. Each item has supplementary resources as well though they are optional:

1. First, please read http://www.businessinsider.com/programmers-confess-unethical-illegal-tasks-asked-of-them-2016-11/. If you have the time and inclination, check out some of the articles linked from that one, not least of which: https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/. Question: Have you ever been asked to do something professionally that was illegal, unethical, or otherwise questionable?
2. Read http://time.com/4471451/cathy-oneil-math-destruction/. You may also want to read http://www.businessinsider.com/racial-bias-in-criminal-courts-2017-1 and/or https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-24/if-fake-news-fools-you-it-can-fool-robots-too/. I also recommend her book: https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/. Question: Can you see how the tools of data science could be used to harm? What "weapons of math destruction" have you seen or could you imagine potentially affecting you and/or being responsible for?
3. Finally, read http://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/. You may also want to check out https://mathbabe.org/2011/10/25/emanuel-dermans-models-behaving-badly/ which includes a (much shorter) “Modeler’s Hippocratic Oath”. Question: Would you be willing to sign one or both of these documents?



​See you all tomorrow,
Donatella​
