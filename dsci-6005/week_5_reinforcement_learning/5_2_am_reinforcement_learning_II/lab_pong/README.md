Overview
-----

We will build the game of [Pong](http://www.ponggame.org) using Pygame and then build a [Deep Q Network](https://www.quora.com/Artificial-Intelligence-What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-how-deep-Q-networks-DQN-work) using TensorFlow. 

We will train the network to play the game. The DQN is a convolutional Neural Network (CNNthat reads in pixel data from the game and the game score.

Usage 
------

Once you've completed the exercises, you can run it like in terminal:
```
python rl.py
```
The longer you let it run, the better it will get.

Adapted to by DataWeekends to TF 1.0, Anaconda python and adapted to be used for an exercise.

Richard Kiss ported to Python 3 and removed OpenCV dependency https://github.com/richardkiss/pong_reinforcement_learning/tree/feature/remove_cv2
