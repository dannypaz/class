    "Welcome to the training neural networks II lab! By the end of this lab you will have\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used a minimal and highly-extensible [sacred](http://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) framework with keras and TensorBoard to experiment with and to visualize a neural network architecture along with its performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a `CNNTrainer` class which builds a convolutional neural network model for MNIST\n",
    "- Do a grid search over a regularization hyperparameter of your choice (e.g. droput, l2 weight decay, or batch normalization)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define your architecture as a `trainer.CNNTrainer` class which extends `trainer.Trainer` in `trainers.py`\n",
    "- Add the hyperparameter you want to grid-search over as a sacred configuation variable in `train.my_config()`\n",
    "- Perform the grid-search over the same set of values from both a jupyter notebook (below) **and** the command line\n",
    "- When using the command line set the `frontend` configuration variable in `train.my_config()` to a value of `'cmd'` and set it to a value of `'jupyter'` when calling from a jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filter your experiment runs in TensorBoard with the regexes `'cmd'` and `'jupyter'` and embed a screenshot of each in this notebook\n",
    "- Make sure to also push your modified versions of `train.py` and `trainers.py`"
