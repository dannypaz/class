Deep Learning Final Project
===

Due date: 5-9-17 at 5p
Purpose: Build an end-to-end system that applies Deep Learning to solve a practical problem.

After doing this assignment you should be able to:

-   Create and tune a Deep Learning model
-   Write working and well-organized code
-   Present your results to a technical audience 

Ideally this project would be become a part of your public Data Science portfolio.  

----
Extra Credit
---
Explore advanced options of your choosing. Suggestions:  

- Search for optimital hyperparameters 
- Combine different architectures (e.g., RNN into Reinforcement Learning system)
- Ability to understand your model (e.g., visualize layers or interpert changes in parameters)
- How would you turn your project in a data product?
- Create automated pipelines to move your project into production.

----
Hints
----

- Go end-to-end as quickly possible. From raw data -> simple model -> evaluation.
    + Then explore alternatives for each stage.
- Make the code run, make it right, make it fast (in that order).
- How do get a "A"? 

> Do something out-of-the-box (seriously).
